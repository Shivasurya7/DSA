268. Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

Follow up: 
Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

        }
        return ((n*(n+1))/2) - sum;

Optimal Approach using XOR:

Intuition:
Two important properties of XOR are the following:

XOR of two same numbers is always 0 i.e. a ^ a = 0. ←Property 1.
XOR of a number with 0 will result in the number itself i.e. 0 ^ a = a.  ←Property 2

Now, let’s XOR all the numbers between 1 to N.
xor1 = 1^2^…….^N

Let’s XOR all the numbers in the given array.
xor2 = 1^2^……^N (contains all the numbers except the missing one).

Now, if we again perform XOR between xor1 and xor2, we will get:
xor1 ^ xor2 = (1^1)^(2^2)^……..^(missing Number)^…..^(N^N)

Here all the numbers except the missing number will form a pair and each pair will result in 0 according to the XOR property. The result will be = 0 ^ (missing number) = missing number (according to property 2).

So, if we perform the XOR of the numbers 1 to N with the XOR of the array elements, we will be left with the missing number.

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

We will first run a loop(say i) from 0 to N-2(as the length of the array = N-1).
Inside the loop, xor2 variable will calculate the XOR of array elements
i.e. xor2 = xor2 ^ a[i].
And the xor1 variable will calculate the XOR of 1 to N-1 i.e. xor1 = xor1 ^ (i+1).
After the loop ends we will XOR xor1 and N to get the total XOR of 1 to N.
Finally, the answer will be the XOR of xor1 and xor2.
Dry run:

Assume the given array is: {1, 2, 4, 5} and N = 5.
XOR of (1 to 5) i.e. xor1 = (1^2^3^4^5)
XOR of array elements i.e. xor2 = (1^2^4^5)
XOR of xor1 and xor2 = (1^2^3^4^5) ^ (1^2^4^5)
			= (1^1)^(2^2)^(3)^(4^4)^(5^5)
			= 0^0^3^0^0 = 0^3 = 3.
The missing number is 3.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N = size of array+1.
Reason: Here, we need only 1 loop to calculate the XOR. The loop runs for approx. N times. So, the time complexity is O(N).

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

    int xor1 = 0, xor2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        xor2 = xor2 ^ a[i]; 
        xor1 = xor1 ^ (i + 1); 
    }
    xor1 = xor1 ^ N; 
    return (xor1 ^ xor2);
